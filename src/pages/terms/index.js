              Camsurf provides interactive chat and camera streaming services to
              users (<strong>interactive services</strong>).
            </p>
            <p>
              We will do our best to assess any possible risks for users from
              third parties when they use any interactive service provided on
              Camsurf, and we will decide in each case whether it is appropriate
              to use moderation of the relevant service (including what kind of
              moderation to use) in the light of those risks. However, we are
              under no obligation to oversee, monitor, or moderate any
              interactive service we provide on Camsurf, and we expressly
              exclude our liability for any loss or damage arising from the use
              of any interactive service by a user in contravention of our
              content standards, whether the service is moderated or not.
            </p>
            <p>
              The use of any of our interactive services by a minor is
              prohibited.
            </p>
            <p>
              Where we do moderate an interactive service, we will normally
              provide you with a means of contacting the moderator, should a
              concern or difficulty arise.

              Camsurf “Repeat Infringer” Policy
            </p>
            <p>
              EF Communications LLC, a Wyoming limited liability company (the “
              <strong>Company</strong>”), the owner and operator of
              <a href="/">Camsurf.com</a> (the “<strong>Website</strong>”), will
              withdraw all rights and privileges from its subscribers and
              account holders (collectively, “<strong>subscribers</strong>”) who
              are deemed repeat infringers. For these purposes, the Company will
              count “<strong>strikes</strong>”. A strike will arise against a
              subscriber every time (1) that it has been adjudicated, in a court
              of competent jurisdiction, to have committed copyright
              infringement; (2) that the Company receives a separate DMCA notice
              that substantially complies with 17 U.S.C. § 512(c)(3), sent on a
              different calendar day from any other DMCA notice, alleging
              copyright infringement within any 12-month period; or (3) that the
              Company has actual knowledge that it has committed an act of
              copyright infringement.
            </p>
            <p>
              Each separate adjudication or DMCA notice gives rise to a separate
              strike. In addition, to the extent that a single adjudication or
              DMCA notice pertains to different copyrights that were infringed
              on different days, it can give rise to multiple strikes.
            </p>
            <p>
              No strike arises from one or more notifications of claimed
              infringement (regardless whether subject to counter-notification
              from the subscriber) that fails to substantially comply with 17
              U.S.C. § 512(c)(3), or from facts or circumstances from which the
              subscriber’s infringement seems apparent, absent actual knowledge
              on the Company’s part.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Company has decided to follow the rule of “two strikes and
              you’re out.” Accordingly, a subscriber against whom there are two
              strikes will be deemed a “<strong>repeat infringer</strong>.” The
              subscriber will be defrocked from the Website as soon as
              practicable (in the ordinary course of business, within one week).
              Nonetheless, the Company reserves the right to remit a strike
              under appropriate circumstances, such as when the subscriber
              provides adequate evidence that it infringed unintentionally or in
              the good faith belief that its conduct did not constitute
              infringement, or that the adjudicating court considered the issue
              of infringement to be open to divergent interpretations. The
              Company will also consider “appropriate circumstances” to remit a
              strike as including a requirement of proportionality: A subscriber
              who engages in widescale exploitation, a small percentage of which
              is determined to constitute copyright infringement (even if
              willfully so), will not accrue a strike if that infringement
              appears aberrational in the entire context of the subscriber’s
              exploitation.
            </p>
            <p>
              A strike will arise by virtue of any act of copyright
              infringement. Typically, those activities will consist of the
              violation of rights provided under Title 17, United States Code.
              However, to the extent that the Company gains actual knowledge
              that a subscriber has violated the copyright laws of a foreign
              country or of one of the several states, that conduct equally
              constitutes a strike. The subject infringement is cognizable
              regardless of whether it occurred in an online context or
              elsewhere.
            </p>
            <p>
              Once defrocked from the Website, the subscriber will not be
              allowed to rejoin the Website until ten years after the most
              recent strike. If a subscriber who was previously defrocked
              returns to the Website, then for a period of one year, the
              subscriber will be “on probation.” If, during that year, the
              Company receives a notification of claimed infringement as to that
              individual—even absent corroboration or court judgment—to which
              the subscriber fails to reply by an appropriate
              counter-notification, the subscriber will be defrocked again. Any
              time that an individual or entity has been twice defrocked, he or
              she will remain permanently unable to rejoin the Website.
            </p>
            <p>
              For these purposes, the Company will maintain a registry of its
              defrocked subscribers. The registry will be updated monthly and
              will retain all implicated names for a period of 30 years.
            </p>
            <p>
              Because of the risks of acting on inaccurate information, the
              Company will not accrue strikes against its subscribers based on
              allegations that those individuals have been previously defrocked
              by another service provider.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Company will accrue a strike with respect to the subscriber
              only. If the subscriber is an entity, that entity will be deemed
              the only entity against whom one strike exists for purposes of the
              repeat infringer policy (meaning that no individual will thereby
              be implicated).
            </p>
            <p>
              Concomitantly, if the subscriber is an individual, he or she will
              be deemed the only individual against whom one strike exists for
              purposes of the repeat infringer policy (meaning that no corporate
              entity will thereby be implicated).
            </p>
            <p>
              Once an individual or entity has been defrocked, the Company will
              not allow another individual or entity bearing substantially the
              identical name and mailing address to enroll in the Website,
              absent evidence showing that it is not the same individual or
              entity that was previously defrocked. In addition, to the extent
              that the Company is provided with evidence that a current
              subscriber is the same individual or entity that was previously
              defrocked, and the current subscriber does not credibly challenge
              that evidence, the Company will terminate service to that
              subscriber. This exclusion does not apply, however, to previously
              defrocked subscribers who are already allowed to join after the
              passage of the requisite years or after satisfying the other
              criteria set forth above.
            </p>
            <p>
              A subscriber’s activity of taking down challenged material or of
              settling a lawsuit for copyright infringement, without more, will
              not be deemed to create a strike. All the circumstances must be
              taken into account. If, for example, in the context of a
              settlement the subscriber admits to having committed copyright
              infringement and the Company gains actual knowledge of that
              admission, a strike arises.
