              If you are contacting us in regards to being banned from the video
              chat platform, please make sure you have fully read our guidelines
              first. While you may feel that your ban is unjust, many users
              break the guidelines without realizing which has resulted in their
              removal from the chat platform.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, if you have fully read the guidelines and still feel that
              you have been banned unfairly, please be sure to include your ban
              ID in your message and explain fully what happened at the time. We
              will then review the case on your behalf.
