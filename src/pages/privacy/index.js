              or what may be of interest to you. This is how we decide which

              You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data

              <li>
                <p>

              <li>
                <p>
                  Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to

                </p>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal

            </p>
            <p>
              Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to

            </p>
            <p>
              We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable

              to make the request.

              <em>Response Timing and Format</em>
            </p>
            <p>
              We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within 45
              days of its receipt. If we require more time (up to 45 days), we
              will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you have an account with us, we will deliver our written
              response to that account. If you do not have an account with us,
              we will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at
              your option.
            </p>
            <p>
              Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period
              preceding the verifiable consumer request’s receipt. The response
              we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a
              request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will
              select a format to provide your personal information that is
              readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information
              from one entity to another entity without hindrance.
            </p>
            <p>
              We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable
              consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly
              unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we
              will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a
              cost estimate before completing your request.

            <p className="ipc-sub-title">Non-Discrimination</p>
            <p>
              We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your
              CCPA rights. Unless permitted by the CCPA, we will not:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>Deny you goods or services.</p>

              <li>
                <p>
                  Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services,
                  including through granting discounts or other benefits, or
                  imposing penalties.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services.

              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for
                  goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or
                  services.
                </p>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              However, we may offer you certain financial incentives permitted
              by the CCPA that <strong>can result</strong> in different prices,
              rates, or quality levels. Any CCPA-permitted financial incentive
              we offer will reasonably relate to your personal information’s
              value and contain written terms that describe the program’s
              material aspects. Participation in a financial incentive program
              requires your prior opt in consent, which you may revoke at any
              time.
