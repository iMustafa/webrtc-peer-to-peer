                  As a random chat site, we have not developed many filters
                  because we want to keep the entire concept of this chat site
                  random. However, you do have the ability to filter users
                  according to their location. In order to do so, click on the
                  Country dropdown menu near the top of the screen and choose a
                  country that you wish to meet people from. You can either
                  choose to meet people from one country at a time or you can
                  view all users randomly.

                  common reason for your country being wrong is that you are
                  using a proxy or you are using an IP that is based in a
                  different country. If you are not using a proxy, please

                  First, make sure that your webcam is plugged in properly and
                  is turned on. Next, verify that your firewall isn't blocking

                  completely to see if the problem gets resolved. If your webcam
